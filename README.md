- Need to figure out logic for marketing site in domain.com and app in app.domain.com
- config/initializers/devise.rb ignore or put the secret file in env

Done
- [x] Devise auth
- [x] setup hot reload with rails_live_reload
- [x] Removed const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme') because not found

## Running the app
Use bin/dev instead of rails s for tailwind to work
